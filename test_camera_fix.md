# Camera and Base64 Fixes Applied

## Camera Issues Fixed:

1. Added `useFocusEffect` to handle camera re-initialization when switching screens
2. Added a `cameraKey` state that increments when screen comes into focus, forcing camera re-render
3. Added `autoFocus` property to camera component
4. Added checks for camera permissions before attempting to capture
5. Added small delay before capture to ensure camera is ready

## Base64 Image Processing Fixed:

1. Added proper `data:image/jpeg;base64,` prefix to images sent to server
2. Added validation for base64 string length and content
3. Added proper error handling and logging in server-side base64 processing
4. Added RGB mode conversion for PIL images
5. Added validation for decoded image data size

## Testing Steps:

1. Open the mobile app
2. Navigate to Camera screen
3. Switch to History screen, then back to Camera - camera should work (not black)
4. Try taking a photo - should see detailed logs in Flask server about image processing
5. If base64 processing fails, the server logs will show exactly where the issue is

## Server Logs to Watch:

- Base64 string length
- Decoded image data length
- PIL image size and mode
- OpenCV image shape
- Any conversion errors with full stack traces
